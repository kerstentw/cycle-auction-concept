# cycle-auction-concept
This is a modeling and conceptualization repo for The Cycle Auction,
a thing that is probably a terrible idea.  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING from this repo
is intended for production use. 

What is a Cycle Auction?  

A cycle auction is an auctioning protocol that creates cycles of weighted random
pricing to create a dynamic market that creates the effect of supply-demand
frontiers for a financial product.  In a more metaphorical way, it combines
OTC pricing with low liquidity price creation by creating counter-party
incentives in a low liquidity options market.

The main benefit of a Cycle Auction is the capacity for incentivizing short term
market making on low liquidity markets.
